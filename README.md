LIDAR-Based Probabilistic Path Planning Simulation and Control of a Planetary Rover Model

This repository contains the implementation and simulation framework for a LIDAR-based probabilistic path planning and control system designed for a planetary rover model. The project leverages advanced sensor data processing and probabilistic algorithms to enable autonomous navigation on extraterrestrial terrains.

# Project Overview

The project simulates a six-wheeled rover with a rocker-bogie suspension system, inspired by NASA's Mars rovers (e.g., Perseverance). It integrates LIDAR data for real-time terrain mapping and employs probabilistic path planning to navigate complex, unstructured environments. The system is designed to optimize path selection while ensuring stability and safety under varying terrain conditions.

# Features





1) LIDAR Integration: Utilizes LIDAR point cloud data for accurate terrain modeling.



2) Probabilistic Path Planning: Implements algorithms to handle uncertainty in terrain data and rover dynamics.



3) Rocker-Bogie Simulation: Models a six-wheeled rover with adaptive suspension for obstacle traversal.



4) Real-Time Control: Provides dynamic control adjustments based on sensor feedback.
